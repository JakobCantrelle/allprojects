Plath v. State of South Carolina, Op. No. 23610, (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 30, 1992) (Davis Adv. Sh. No. 9 at 26). The opinion which follows this order is hereby substituted. The following changes have been made in the original opinion: IT IS SO ORDERED. AS AMENDED ON REHEARING. 160*160 TOAL, Justice: These cases are appeals from the denial of Post-Conviction Relief by the circuit court. We affirm. HISTORY OF THE CASE HISTORY OF THE CASE On April 12, 1978, Betty Gardner hitchhiked a ride with John Arnold, John Plath, Cindy Sheets, and Carol Ulman. The foursome first took Betty Gardner to her brother's home. Betty asked if they would then take her to work. They drove to a dirt road in rural Beaufort County and let Betty out of the car. After some discussion, the foursome turned the car around and picked Betty up, ostensibly to take her to work. From there they went down a dirt road to a garbage dump where Betty Gardner was brutally murdered. On June 25, 1978, Cindy Sheets led the authorities to Betty Gardner's badly decomposed body. John Arnold and John Plath were tried together for the murder of Betty Gardner. Cindy Sheets, Carol Ulman and John Plath testified at the trial. Cindy Sheets received immunity from prosecution provided she told the truth at the trial of John Arnold and John Plath. The record does not reveal the disposition of any charges against Carol Ulman. However, the record does reveal that Carol Ulman was eleven years old on April 12, 1978, the day of the murder, and twelve years old at the time of the trial. Plath and Arnold stood trial together before The Honorable Clyde A. Eltzroth and a jury. The guilt phase of the trial commenced on January 22, 1979. On February 5, 1979, the jury found John Plath and John Arnold guilty of the murder of Betty Gardner. After a separate penalty phase proceeding, the same jury found the aggravating circumstance of kidnapping as to each defendant and returned verdicts of death on the 9th of February, 1979. Both John Plath and John Arnold appealed to this Court. This Court upheld their convictions on direct appeal, but reversed and remanded the penalty or sentencing phase of the trial. State v. Plath & Arnold, 277 S.C. 126, 284 S.E. (2d) 221 (1981). On remand, a second jury sentenced John Plath and John Arnold to death for the murder of Betty Gardner. In the second sentencing trial, the solicitor put forth assault with intent to ravish as well as kidnapping as 161*161 aggravating circumstances. The sentencing jury found John Plath guilty of both kidnapping and assault with intent to ravish and John Arnold guilty of kidnapping. Both defendants appealed the second death sentence. This Court affirmed the second death sentence on direct appeal. State v. Plath & Arnold, 281 S.C. 1, 313 S.E. (2d) 619, cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1265, 104 S.Ct. 3560, 82 L.Ed. (2d) 862, reh. den., 468 U.S. 1226, 105 S.Ct. 27, 82 L.Ed. (2d) 920 (1984). In separate petitions, both defendants sought Post-Conviction Relief. The PCR judge denied Arnold relief on December 14, 1985. This Court declined to grant certiorari. Arnold appealed to the United States Supreme Court. On January 19, 1988, on Petition for Writ of Certiorari to the Court of Common Pleas of South Carolina, Beaufort County, the United States Supreme Court remanded the case to the circuit court. The Supreme Court's remand order provides as follows: Arnold v. South Carolina, 484 U.S. 1022, 108 S.Ct. 743, 98 L. Ed. (2d) 757 (1988); see also Plath v. South Carolina, 484 U.S. 1022, 108 S.Ct. 743, 98 L.Ed. (2d) 757 (1988) (identical language). Yates v. Aiken, supra, ("Yates, II"), cited by the Supreme Court in its remand order, deals with malice charges given in the 1980 murder trial of Dale Yates. In Yates, the charges instructed the jury that malice could be presumed or inferred from the doing of an unlawful act and from the use of a deadly weapon. In Yates, II, these charges were held to constitute an unconstitutional shifting of the burden of proof from the State to the defendant. Thus, in Arnold, on remand from the United States Supreme Court, the PCR proceedings now focused on the malice charges given by the trial judge in the guilt phase of the first trial. Additional PCR hearings were held on May 18, 1988 and November 15, 1989. The PCR judge denied Arnold relief by his orders dated May 5, 1989 and March 5, 1990. Arnold now appeals the denial of PCR relief. We granted certiorari to review the decision of the PCR judge. 162*162 John Plath was denied postconviction relief on May 12, 1986. This Court denied his petition of certiorari. Plath then petitioned the United States Supreme Court for certiorari. The United States Supreme Court granted Plath's petition and remanded the case to the South Carolina Circuit Court in language identical to the Arnold remand order. Plath v. South Carolina, 484 U.S. 1022, 108 S.Ct. 743, 98 L.Ed. (2d) 757 (1988). Now focusing on the malice charge issue, additional post-conviction relief hearings were held on May 18, 1988 and November 15, 1989. The circuit court denied Plath's application for postconviction relief by orders dated May 5, 1989 and March 5, 1990. We granted certiorari to review the orders of the circuit court. Because each petitioner presents the same questions of law and the same facts, we consolidate the two cases for the purpose of this opinion. ISSUES ISSUES 1. Did the circuit court err in holding that the malice charge given by the trial judge was not an unconstitutional shifting of the burden of proof to the defendant? 2. If the malice charge was error, did the circuit court err in holding that the error was harmless? 3. Did the circuit court err in holding that petitioner's motion to amend the post-conviction relief petition was untimely? ANALYSIS ANALYSIS 1. Did the circuit court err in holding that the malice charge given by the trial judge was not an unconstitutional shifting of the burden of proof to the defendant? The PCR judge found that the malice charge was not an unconstitutional shifting of the burden of proof. We disagree. The malice charge given by the trial judge is similar to the malice charge given in Yates v. Evatt, 500 U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 1884, 114 L.Ed. (2d) 432 (1991).[1] At trial in the instant case, the judge gave the following jury charge on malice: (Tr. at 1959-1962.)[2] The trial judge instructed the jury on two mandatory presumptions of malice. First, the jury was instructed that "[m]alice may be implied or presumed from the willful, deliberate and intentional doing of an unlawful act without just cause or excuse." (Tr. at 1960.) Next, the jury was instructed: 165*165 (Tr. at 1960-1961.) Following both charges, the jury was instructed that the presumptions are rebuttable. (Tr. at 1960-1961.) The United States Supreme Court has held both of these presumptions to be an unconstitutional shifting of the burden of proof from the prosecution to the defendant. Yates v. Aiken, 484 U.S. 211, 108 S.Ct. 534, 98 L.Ed. (2d) 546 (1988); Francis v. Franklin, 471 U.S. 307, 105 S.Ct. 1965, 85 L.Ed. (2d) 344 (1985); Sandstrom v. Montana, 442 U.S. 510, 99 S.Ct. 2450, 61 L.Ed. (2d) 39 (1979).[3] Thus, we hold the Post-Conviction Relief judge erred in holding that the trial court judge's charge on the issue of malice was not an unconstitutional shifting of the burden from the prosecution to the defendant. 2. If the malice charge was error, did the circuit court err in holding that the error was harmless? Consistent with Rose v. Clark, 478 U.S. 570, 582, 106 S. Ct. 3101, 3108, 92 L.Ed. (2d) 460 (1986), we now address the issue of whether "beyond a reasonable doubt the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained." Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed. (2d) 705 (1967). This analysis was recently clarified and reviewed at length in Yates v. Evatt, 500 U.S. ___, 111 S.Ct. 1884, 114 L.Ed. (2d) 432 (1991) ("Yates, III"). Our Rose v. Clark harmless error analysis of the malice charge will track as closely as possible the analytic framework set forth by Justice Souter writing for the Court in Yates III. The "requirement that harmlessness of federal constitutional error be clear beyond reasonable doubt embodies [a] standard requiring reversal if `there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.'" Yates v. Evatt, 500 U.S. ___, ___, 111 S.Ct. 1884, 1892, 114 L.Ed. (2d) 432, 448 (1991) (quoting Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. at 24, 87 S.Ct. at 828). Id., 500 U.S. at ___, 111 S.Ct. at 1893, 114 L.Ed. (2d) at 448-49. "The first step in determining whether these instructions contributed to the jury's verdict is to determine what evidence the jury considered on the issue of [malice], independently of the presumptions themselves." Id. at ___, 111 S.Ct. at 1895, 114 L.Ed. (2d) at 452. A review of the record reveals some evidence tending to rebut malice, including Plath's testimony that he and Arnold did not participate in the murder of 167*167 Betty Gardner rather Cindy Sheets committed the murder. Thus, the jury was "free to look beyond the unlawful act presumption and to consider all the evidence on malice." Id. at ___, 111 S.Ct. at 1895-96, 114 L.Ed. (2d) at 452. The record reveals that the jury heard the testimony of Cindy Sheets, Carol Ulman and John Plath, all of whom admitted to being present at the garbage dump when Betty Gardner was killed. The jury also heard testimony from Dr. Trefni, forensic pathologist. The testimony relating to malice is summarized as follows. The following evidence of malice on the part of petitioner Plath was presented to the jury through the testimony of the eyewitness. The record of the 1979 trial contains the following eyewitness evidence of malice on the part of petitioner Arnold: The record contains the following eyewitness evidence of malice on the part of Cindy Sheets. Dr. Trefni, the pathologist, testified that he viewed the partially skeletonized body on June 26, 1978. He found the following 170*170 injuries: fractured skull, fracture of the face bones, and marks on the ribs most likely caused by a knife. (Tr. 1693.) An examination of the entire record reveals that Betty Gardner was brutally murdered. She died from either strangulation, crushed skull, multiple stab wounds or a combination thereof. Because the body was badly decomposed, the pathologist was unable to establish whether or not Betty Gardner died of strangulation. However, three of the four persons at the garbage dump with Betty Gardner on the day she died testified that she was stabbed multiple times but that something more was required to kill her. Even under his own testimony, John Plath states that while he did not want to be further involved, he was aware that Cindy Sheets was in the woods choking Betty Gardner because the stab wounds did not kill her. His testimony also established malice on the part of Cindy Sheets when Cindy allegedly stabbed Betty Gardner. The testimony is conflicting as to who actually stabbed and choked Betty Gardner. The trial judge properly charged the jury on accomplice liability. Thus, the conflicting testimony as to which of the four actually killed Betty Gardner was irrelevant as to the guilt or innocence of John Plath and John Arnold, provided the jury found accomplice liability. The testimony of Cindy Sheets and Carol Ulman establishes express malice on the part of John Arnold, John Plath and Cindy Sheets. The testimony of John Plath establishes express malice on the part of Cindy Sheets. The probative force of the evidence was such that beyond a reasonable doubt the jury could not have rested its verdict on a presumption of malice. Throughout the jury charge on malice, the trial judge continually reminded the jurors to base their verdict on all the evidence presented and to establish the fact beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, we cannot assume that the jurors based their verdict on the presumption that malice existed with the use of a deadly weapon. A reasonable juror would have listened to all of the instructions and evaluated all of the evidence. Further, it is clear that the presumption of malice from the use of a deadly weapon beyond a reasonable doubt did not contribute to the verdict in this case. The direct evidence of the brutality 171*171 of each of the participants is overwhelming. Cindy Sheets, Carol Ulman and John Plath testified that Betty Gardner did not die from the knife wounds alone. The pathologist's testimony established that Betty Gardner was severely beaten as well as stabbed. Thus, all of the testimony established that Betty Gardner died from severe head wounds, strangulation and knife wounds. Further, even if the jury found malice from the use of a deadly weapon, the testimony of Cindy Sheets, Carol Ulman, John Plath and the pathologist established that Betty Gardner was stabbed multiple times. The testimony established malice well beyond a presumption. After an evaluation of all of the evidence presented on malice and an evaluation of the jury charge, we find that beyond a reasonable doubt the jury did not rest its verdict on a presumption of malice from the use of a deadly weapon. Beyond a reasonable doubt the error did not contribute to the verdict. Thus, the error was harmless. The jury was also charged that they could presume malice from the willful, deliberate and intentional doing of an unlawful act without just cause or excuse. Again the trial judge reminded the jury to base their verdict on all of the evidence presented. Thus, we conclude that the jury listened to all of the evidence tending to prove or disprove malice. The intent to kill Betty Gardner is clear. Even the testimony of John Plath establishes malice on the part of Cindy Sheets. If the jury believed all of John Plath's testimony, he would have been acquitted under the trial judge's charges on accomplice liability. John Arnold, however, would have been convicted under at least accomplice liability based upon the testimony of either Cindy Sheets, Carol Ulman or John Plath. John Plath was not acquitted; therefore, it is clear that the jury did not believe he was completely uninvolved with the murder of Betty Gardner. More significantly, the testimony of John Plath established express malice. Based upon all the evidence presented tending to prove or disprove malice, no rational juror could have failed to find malice. All versions presented to the jury established beyond reasonable doubt the intentional, malicious torture and murder of Betty Gardner. After a full review of the evidence presented tending to prove or disprove malice, we find beyond a 172*172 reasonable doubt the jury did not rest its verdict on the presumption of malice. The erroneous malice charge beyond a reasonable doubt did not contribute to the verdict. Thus, the error was harmless. 3. Did the circuit court err holding that petitioner's motion to amend the postconviction relief petition was untimely? The remand from the United States Supreme Court was heard by the circuit court on May 18, 1988. The circuit court issued its order on May 5, 1989. On May 9, 1989, Plath filed a motion to amend his petition for PCR. Arnold also filed a motion to amend his petition for PCR on May 12, 1989. Both petitioners filed a motion under Rule 59(e), SCRCP to amend the judgment on May 12, 1989. The motions were made after the circuit court had issued its orders denying postconviction relief on remand from the United States Supreme Court. The circuit court held hearings on both petitioners' motions. The circuit court denied both petitioners' motion to amend as untimely. The circuit court also held that the Rule 59(e), SCRCP was not the proper vehicle to amend a petition for post-conviction relief to add additional grounds for relief. We agree. Post-Conviction Relief Actions are provided for by the Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act, S.C. Ann. §§ 17-27-10-120 (1976). South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure 71.1(a) directs that the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure shall apply to post-conviction relief actions to the extent the rules are not inconsistent with the Uniform Post-Conviction Procedure Act. When a party wishes to amend a pleading after final judgment from a full trial on the merits, South Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b) applies. Amendments under South Carolina Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b) are allowed not to assert new claims, but rather to conform the pleadings to the evidence presented at trial. See Baxley v. Rosenblum, 303 S.C. 340, 400 S.E. (2d) 502 (Ct. App. 1991). Thus, petitioners' motion to amend the postconviction relief petition was properly denied by the circuit court. The purpose of Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the judgment is to request the trial judge to "reconsider matters properly encompassed in a decision on the merits." Budinich 173*173 v. Becton Dickinson and Co., 486 U.S. 196, 200, 108 S.Ct. 1717, 1720, 100 L.Ed. (2d) 178, 184 (1988) (citing White v. New Hampshire Dept. of Employment Security, 455 U.S. 445, 451, 102 S.Ct. 1162, 1166, L.Ed. (2d) 325, 330-31 (1982) ). The petitioners, here, sought after full hearings and a decision on the merits to add new grounds and new claims for postconviction relief. The trial judge was correct in denying their motions. The gravamen of petitioners' motions is a request for subsequent petitions for postconviction relief. South Carolina Code Ann. Section 17-27-90 provides: "This statute forbids a successive PCR application unless an applicant can point to a `sufficient reason' why the new grounds for relief he asserts were not raised, or were not raised properly." Aice v. State, ___ S.C. ___, 409 S.E. (2d) 392, 393-94 (1991). Additionally, "[t]his Court has by promulgation of rule interpreted Section 17-27-90 and the phrase `sufficient reason' very narrowly." Id. Supreme Court Rule 50(3) states: The petitioners failed to present to the circuit court facts and circumstances to show why the new grounds were not and 174*174 could not have been presented in the prior petitions[4] nor have they presented any to this Court. We affirm the circuit court's decision denying petitioners' motions. We affirm. HARWELL, C.J., CHANDLER and FINNEY, JJ., and GEORGE T. GREGORY, JR., Acting Associate Justice, concur. [1] This is the subsequent United States Supreme Court ruling in the same case as Yates v. Aiken, 484 U.S. 211, 108 S.Ct. 534, 98 L. Ed. (2d) 546 (1988) (referred to herein as Yates II). [2] Unless otherwise noted, all references are to the transcript of the guilt phase of the original trial in this matter which is part of the Transcript of Record filed by Petitioners in State v. Plath & Arnold, 277 S.C. 126, 284 S.E. (2d) 221 (1981). [3] In fairness to the trial judge, it should be noted that the malice charge we are now reviewing was given on February 5, 1979. He did not have the benefit of the United States Supreme Court's decision in Sandstrom v. Montana, supra, which was not issued until June 18, 1979. Although the Supreme Court points out in Sandstrom, supra, 442 U.S. at 514, fn. 3, 99 S.Ct. at 2454, fn. 3, that some federal and state courts had disapproved similar instructions, Sandstrom provided the dispositive constitutional analysis. [4] Both petitioners have amended at least once their original petitions. The underlying conviction and the petitions for post-conviction relief have been reviewed at least five times by the circuit court, four times by this Court, and three times by the United States Supreme Court.
