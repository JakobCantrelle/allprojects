Gomori v. Arnold, 533 F. 2d 871 - Court of Appeals, 3rd Circuit 1976 Steve GOMORI, Jr., Appellant, v. Floyd ARNOLD et al. United States Court of Appeals, Third Circuit. 872*872 Steve Gomori, Jr., pro se. S. John Cottone, U. S. Atty., Laurence M. Kelly, Asst. U. S. Atty., Scranton, Pa., for appellee. Before SEITZ, Chief Judge, and VAN DUSEN and WEIS, Circuit Judges. OPINION OF THE COURT OPINION OF THE COURT VAN DUSEN, Circuit Judge. This appeal challenges the district court's denial of a federal prisoner's petition for a writ of habeas corpus, contending that the Warden of the U.S. Northeastern Penitentiary[*] has erroneously computed his effective release date under a federal sentence 873*873 imposed on September 8, 1969, by the United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia. We affirm. The chronology of four separate sentences the petitioner has been serving since April 29, 1970, is as follows: On April 29, 1971, petitioner was paroled from his Ohio state sentence and transferred to Pennsylvania to begin service of the sentence described under 1 above. He was released by the Pennsylvania Parole Board on February 20, 1974, and transferred to Lewisburg for service of the West Virginia federal sentence, since a detainer based on that sentence had been filed with the Pennsylvania authorities. Petitioner contends that he has been held in illegal custody contrary to 18 U.S.C. § 4163 "after complete service of his legal sentence on May 1, 1975, of six years,"[3] since the effective commencement of the federal West Virginia sentence was January 19, 1971, when the Ohio federal sentencing judge recommended that a state institution be designated as the place of service for the Ohio federal sentence. On the other hand, respondent contends that the West Virginia federal sentence could not have commenced prior to February 20, 1974, when he was released from state custody and arrived at the federal penitentiary to serve the remainder of his federal sentences described under 2 and 4 above. I. I. Preliminarily, we face the issue of whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction of this petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed by a federal prisoner in the district where he is imprisoned[4] under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, in view of the terms of 28 U.S.C. § 2255, providing that a federal prisoner In Sobell v. Attorney General of U.S., Dept. of Justice, 400 F.2d 986 (3d Cir. 1968), we held that a claim by a defendant that he was entitled to credit for time served from the date of his arrest to the date of his federal sentence must be determined by the sentencing court under the terms of 28 U.S.C. § 2255, using this language at 988: In this case, credit is being claimed for time served in state institutions subsequent to the imposition of the September 1969 federal West Virginia sentence and without either any indication that the West Virginia federal sentencing judge could have known the Pennsylvania sentence would be affirmed on appeal or that the Ohio crime had been committed. As stated in Soyka v. Alldredge, 481 F.2d 303, 306 (3d Cir. 1973), where petitioner challenges the effect of events "subsequent" to his sentence on that sentence, the habeas corpus remedy in 28 U.S.C. § 2241 is an appropriate remedy. This reasoning is supported by the emphasis placed by the Supreme Court of the United States in United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, 217 at note 25, 72 S.Ct. 263, 271, 96 L.Ed. 232, 240 (1952), on the purpose of 28 U.S.C. § 2255 as a remedy to correct erroneous sentences resulting from events in the trial court at or before sentencing. The major purpose was "to hold any required hearing in the sentencing court because of the inconvenience of transporting court officials and other necessary witnesses [readily available to the trial court] to the district of confinement" (220-21 of 342 U.S., 273 of 72 S.Ct., 242 of 96 L.Ed.). The Court in Hayman used this language at 218, 219 and 223, 72 S.Ct. at 272, 274, 96 L.Ed. at 241, 244: Furthermore, the United States Courts of Appeals have consistently held that a challenge to a sentence as executed by the prison and parole authorities may be made by petition for a writ of habeas corpus, whereas a challenge to the sentence as imposed must be made under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Halprin v. United States, 295 F.2d 458, 459 (9th Cir. 1961); Freeman v. United States, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 15, 254 F.2d 352, 353-54 (1958); Costner v. United States, 180 F.2d 892 (4th Cir. 1950);[6] cf. United States ex rel. Marrero v. Warden, 483 F.2d 656, 660-61 (3d Cir. 1973), reversed on other grounds, 417 U.S. 653, 94 S.Ct. 2532, 41 L.Ed.2d 383 (1975); Soyka v. Alldredge, supra. For the foregoing reasons, we have concluded that the district court had jurisdiction over the petition for a writ of habeas corpus. II. II. Petitioner relies on this language at 18 U.S.C. § 3568 in support of his contention that the West Virginia sentence began on January 19, 1971: However, petitioner was not received at either the Ohio or Pennsylvania institution for service of the West Virginia federal sentence. As stated in Hayward v. Looney, 246 F.2d 56, 58 (10th Cir. 1957), "the Federal sentence does not begin to run until such time as the prisoner is returned to Federal custody and received at the Federal penal institution for service of his Federal sentence." Similarly, in United States v. Kanton, 362 F.2d 178, 179 at 179-80 (7th Cir. 1966), the court said: A federal court has no power to direct that a federal sentence shall run concurrently with a state sentence. See United States v. Janiec, 505 F.2d 983, 987-88 (3d Cir. 1974). As noted in that case, a federal judge may recommend to the Attorney General that he designate a state institution as the place of service of a federal sentence in order to make it concurrent with a state sentence being served at that institution. See United States v. DeVino, 531 F.2d 182 (Opinion of March 4, 1976, 3d Cir.). The West Virginia federal court made no such recommendation, even though the Pennsylvania sentence had been entered more than seven months prior to its sentence, and the Attorney General made no such designation for service of the West Virginia federal sentence. The rule of presumptive concurrency of sentences, in the absence of a specific directive that sentences be served consecutively, does not apply where one sentence is imposed by a federal court and the other by a state court. See Verdejo v. Willingham, 876*876 198 F.Supp. 748 (M.D.Pa.1961), and cases there cited. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court will be affirmed. [*] Floyd Arnold is the Warden. Presumably the "et al." included in the caption refers to his subordinate personnel and his colleagues in the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. [1] The district court judgment of sentence was affirmed on April 12, 1971. [2] The transcript of the sentence includes this wording: ". . . therefore it is the order and judgment of this Court and the recommendation of this Court that the Attorney General of the United States designate the State institution in which you are presently confined in the State of Ohio, or any other State institution in the State of Ohio to which you may be subsequently transferred for any reason, as the place for serving this Federal sentence. "It is further ordered that at such time as you are released from State custody in the State of Ohio, or such time as you are released for any purpose either having served the sentence or paroled prior to the serving of the State sentence in Ohio, that you not be detained or retained in Federal custody or transferred to a Federal institution to serve the balance of this sentence, but rather that you be released to the State of Pennsylvania and to commence serving the State of Pennsylvania sentence. The Court at that time will then designate and does hereby designate for the balance of any sentence that there may be remaining with respect to this Federal sentence, the Court will then and does hereby designate and recommend that the Attorney General of the United States designate any State institution in Pennsylvania for the serving of the balance of this Federal sentence." (Emphasis supplied.) No reference was made at the sentencing to the prior West Virginia federal sentence.

[3] At page 21 of his brief, Gomori states: "Presumptive concurrency doctrine was applicable to the two non-consecutive federal sentences with effective date of service as January 19, 1971, with a mandatory release date of May 1, 1975 for the longest of the two sentences served." "Presumptive concurrency doctrine was applicable to the two non-consecutive federal sentences with effective date of service as January 19, 1971, with a mandatory release date of May 1, 1975 for the longest of the two sentences served."

[6] In Costner, supra, the court used this language: "We think it clear, however, that the court has no jurisdiction to entertain a motion of this sort under 28 U.S.C.A. § 2255, which merely provides a remedy in the nature of writ of error coram nobis for attacking the judgment and sentence under which a prisoner is incarcerated. The attack here is not upon the judgment of the court, but upon action of the prison authorities."
