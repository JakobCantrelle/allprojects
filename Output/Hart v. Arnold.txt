Hart v. Arnold, 884 A. 2d 316 - Pa: Superior Court 2005 David L. HART & Ann B. Hart, Appellees, v. James P. ARNOLD, Appellant. Superior Court of Pennsylvania. 321*321 Jason J. Legg, Montrose, for appellant. Charles M. Watkins, Reading, for appellees. BEFORE: LALLY-GREEN, GANTMAN, and CAVANAUGH,[*] JJ. 322*322 OPINION BY GANTMAN, J.: ¶ 1 Appellant, James P. Arnold, appeals from the judgment entered in the Susquehanna County Court of Common Pleas in favor of Appellees, David L. Hart and Ann B. Hart, in his action for breach of contract and related claims. Appellant asks us to determine whether the trial court erred when it denied him any relief on his breach of contract claim on the ground of mutual mistake of fact, and when it dismissed his claims for fraud, punitive damages, and counsel fees. We hold that the court erred when it excused Appellees from contractual liability on the ground of mutual mistake of fact. We further hold that the court properly dismissed Appellant's fraud and punitive damages claims. Finally, we remand the matter for further proceedings regarding damages on Appellant's breach of contract claim and his claim for counsel fees. Accordingly, we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. ¶ 2 The relevant facts and procedural history of this case are as follows. In 1986, Appellees initiated efforts to obtain approval to construct, operate, and maintain a dam on their property. The purpose of the dam was to create a lake by impounding water from a branch of Pettis Creek in Bridgewater Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. ¶ 3 Appellees obtained a permit from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Regulation ("DER") to construct the impoundment. The DER permit also required approval from the Army Corps of Engineers ("ACE"). The DER permit was valid until December 31, 1988. The ACE permit was also valid for only two years, but ACE did not communicate this fact to Appellees until 1990. ¶ 4 After a site inspection of Appellees' property in May 1990, ACE informed Appellees that their 1986 ACE Permit had expired on August 29, 1988. Further, Ace informed Appellees their project involved work beyond that permitted under nationwide authorization, and Appellees would have to apply for an individualized permit in accordance with current regulations. Appellees took the position that their 1986 ACE permit was still valid. Nevertheless, Appellees applied for an individualized permit to create the impoundment. In July 1990, ACE notified Appellees that their application was incomplete in many respects. Further, ACE told Appellees that, prior to any approval, certain wetland impact studies had to be performed. Despite their ongoing dispute with ACE over the validity of the 1986 permit, Appellees expressed their intention to continue work on the dam in October 1990. In November 1990, a public notice and comment period was held, which gave rise to certain environmental issues ACE believed needed to be addressed before the dam could be finished and impoundment of the lake could begin. For the first time, ACE began to consider a reduction in the size of the impoundment to meet negative comments from various environmental agencies, particularly with respect to the degradation of surrounding wetlands. ACE told Appellees to complete their reapplication and to submit alternative plans for a smaller impoundment. Appellees did not comply. ¶ 5 In December 1991, ACE informed Appellees that their incomplete application was deemed withdrawn due to their inaction and their failure to submit alternative plans for a smaller impoundment. Appellees' immediate response was to reiterate that their ACE permit was still valid, a position Appellees continued to maintain through 1993. ¶ 6 In February 1993, Appellees entered into an agreement with Appellant, whereby 323*323 the parties agreed that Appellant would transfer 55 acres of real property to Appellees in exchange for $125,000.00 and Appellees' promise to create a 20.8 acre lake by constructing a dam of sufficient size and strength to allow for flaring out the proposed impoundment on Appellant's land as contemplated by the parties. Appellees agreed to undertake the costs and responsibility for construction of a dam, on land owed by them and for obtaining all approvals required by government agencies. (See Agreement for the Sale of Real Estate, attached as Exhibit A to Appellees' Original Complaint against Appellant, filed 9/1/95, ¶¶ 4, 5; R.R. at 11a-17a). ¶ 7 By virtue of their agreement, the parties intended to create lakefront acreage on their adjacent properties with a reciprocal easement. The area and depth of the lake were essential to the parties' agreement, because (1) a smaller lake would not reach the intended shoreline and (2) the depth of the lake was essential to the type of recreational water activities that could be enjoyed by potential consumers of the lakefront property (such as swimming, fishing, and recreational boating). (See Trial Court Opinion, filed July 11, 2002, at 1). Closing occurred on April 2, 1993. Pursuant to the parties' agreement, at closing, $25,000.00 of the sale price was put in an interest-bearing escrow account and earmarked for the construction of the dam. "The intent of the parties was to have lakefront property on their adjacent real property by virtue of a Reciprocal Easement Agreement." (Id.) ¶ 8 Later that month Appellant contacted ACE to determine the status of Appellees' permit. ACE informed Appellant that Appellees had taken no action on their reapplication for a permit and it had been deemed withdrawn. On May 15, 1993, Appellant reiterated to Appellees in writing that the $25,000.00 held in escrow was to be used only for construction of a dam for a 20.8 acre lake. Subsequently, Appellees informed Appellant by letter that he needed to move certain power lines on his property to facilitate completion of the project. ¶ 9 In June 1993, Appellant again contacted ACE. ACE informed Appellant that Appellees' project was not authorized, and if construction were actually taking place, then the ACE enforcement division would have to get involved. Over the course of the next few months, ACE sent several cease-and-desist letters to Appellees concerning the construction of the impoundment and the status of their permit. A letter ACE sent to Appellees in July 1993 not only reissued earlier warnings but also stated a meeting would be scheduled between ACE and Appellees to discuss ACE's position regarding the permit and the impoundment. ¶ 10 In September 1993, Appellees and their attorney met with representatives of ACE and the U.S. Attorney's Office. The U.S. Attorney informed Appellees that he was considering an injunction to prevent completion of the project. Following their meeting, Appellees agreed not to complete the project until the permit process was concluded. At that time, Appellees also agreed to consider other project options to avoid degradation of wetlands, namely a reduction in the size of the impoundment. After the meeting, Appellees filed a new permit application for a 12.4 acre impoundment at 1500.57 feet. Appellant was not consulted about this reduction in size. ACE held another notice and comment period in November 1993 for an impoundment of only 12.4 acres. ¶ 11 In January 1994, ACE offered Appellees two options, neither of which was sufficient to satisfy the original agreement between the parties. In June 1994, ACE issued a permit for a 12.4 acre impoundment 324*324 at 1500.57 feet. Appellees constructed a dam utilizing Appellant's funds and created a 12.4 acre impoundment.[1] ¶ 12 Nevertheless, between June and November 1994, Appellees' counsel continued to send letters to Appellant stating that Appellant's failure to move certain utility poles was the sole obstacle to the construction of the 20.8 acre lake as contemplated by the parties' agreement. In November 1994, Appellees' attorney sent another letter to Appellant regarding removal of the utility poles so that the impoundment as originally contemplated could be created. A month later Appellees' attorney threatened legal action if Appellant did not move the designated utility poles. ¶ 13 Appellees finally sued Appellant on September 1, 1995, alleging claims for breach of contract (based on Appellant's failure to move certain utility poles), fraud (based on Appellant's promise to move the utility poles), punitive damages, damages for "inconvenience and aggravation," and counsel fees. In Count I (Breach of Contract), Appellees averred the parties had entered into an agreement for the creation of an "approximately twenty acre impoundment of water, on land owned by the parties;" Appellees further averred, "[Appellees] agreed to undertake the costs and responsibility for construction of a dam, on land owned by [Appellees] and of obtaining all approvals required by government agencies." (Appellees' Complaint, filed 9/1/95, ¶¶ 4-5; R.R. at 2a-3a). ¶ 14 Appellant filed preliminary objections. Following briefing and oral argument, the court sustained Appellant's preliminary objections to the extent that Appellees' claims for attorney fees, damages for "inconvenience and aggravation," and punitive damages were stricken. Appellees were allowed to proceed on their remaining claim for breach of contract and special damages. The court's order was dated January 23, 1996 and filed on January 24, 1996. ¶ 15 Appellant duly filed an answer to the remaining counts of the complaint, with new matter and counterclaims. Appellant's counterclaims alleged breach of contract, diminished value of his land as a result of Appellees' creation of a significantly smaller 12-acre impoundment, fraud, ejectment, monetary losses (including those Appellant incurred as a result of having already moved some of the utility poles), counsel fees and costs. ¶ 16 Appellees filed their answer with new matter to Appellant's counterclaims on February 27, 1996. Curiously, Appellees denied that the parties had ever contemplated an impoundment of any specific size or that Appellees had unilaterally downsized the impoundment. Instead, Appellees maintained the agreement contemplated that the actual area of the impoundment would depend on what ACE would ultimately allow. Appellees further contended the only obstacle to construction of the impoundment as agreed was Appellant's failure to relocate the utility lines. ¶ 17 Appellant filed a reply to Appellees' new matter, denying any contractual duty to relocate utility lines. By agreement of the parties, on May 13, 1996, Appellant filed an amended answer with new matter and counterclaim to include additional money damages, without any change to the theory of his original counterclaims. Throughout the remainder of 1996 and into 325*325 1997, discovery ensued. The matter was continued indefinitely in 1997, due in part to Appellees' bankruptcy filing. The bankruptcy proceedings were resolved on January 22, 1999. ¶ 18 In August 2000, the court notified the parties of its intent to discontinue the matter due to lack of significant docket activity. By order dated November 6, 2000, and filed November 8, 2000, the case was relisted for trial. Trial was eventually scheduled for October 22, 2001. ¶ 19 On October 12, 2001, the parties deposed Dr. Thomas G. Pluto, Ph.D., a biologist and employee of ACE. In his deposition, Dr. Pluto stated that rerouting the utility poles was irrelevant to the size of the impoundment. Following this deposition, Appellees withdrew their complaint against Appellant on October 16, 2001. Appellant's counterclaims, however, proceeded on two non-consecutive days of trial, after which the parties filed post-trial briefs. ¶ 20 By order dated July 9, 2002 and filed July 11, 2002, the court granted Appellant relief on his ejectment claim and ordered Appellees to remove the fence placed on Appellant's property within 60 days. The court further ordered Appellees to pay Appellant the sum of $25,000.00 from the escrow account, plus interest from 5/13/93, for the unauthorized use of the escrow funds. With the exception of the ejectment action and the unauthorized use of the escrow money, the court ruled that all other expenses and damages Appellant alleged were the result of a mutual mistake; and, the parties were to bear their own expenses and damages, including legal fees. ¶ 21 On July 22, 2002, Appellees timely filed post-verdict motions requesting relief from the court's order directing them to pay Appellant $25,000.00 plus interest for the unauthorized use of the escrow funds. Appellant also timely filed post-verdict motions requesting relief on his claims of breach of contract, fraudulent inducement, fraud, punitive damages, and attorney's fees and costs. On May 12, 2003, the trial court filed its opinion and order dated May 6, 2003, granting Appellees' motion for post-verdict relief and vacating that part of the court's July 2002 order in which the court ordered Appellees to pay Appellant the $25,000.00 held in escrow plus interest since 1993. The court further denied Appellant's motion for post-verdict relief. On June 11, 2003, Appellant filed his notice of appeal.[2] By order dated June 17, 2003, and filed on June 19, 2003, the trial court ordered Appellant to file a Rule 1925(b) concise statement of matters complained of on appeal. Appellant filed his Rule 1925(b) statement on June 27, 2003. 326*326 ¶ 22 The following time line summarizes the parties' significant activities and interactions, upon which this case is based: ¶ 23 On appeal, Appellant raises eight issues for our review: (Appellant's Brief at 5-7). ¶ 24 The relevant standard of review of a court's decision in a non-jury trial is as follows: Croyle v. Dellape, 832 A.2d 466, 470 (Pa.Super.2003) (citing Behar v. Frazier, 724 A.2d 943, 946 (Pa.Super.1999)). The court's findings are especially binding on appeal, where they are based upon the credibility of the witnesses, "unless it appears that the court abused its discretion or that the court's findings lack evidentiary support or that the court capriciously disbelieved the evidence." Fudula v. Keystone Wire & Iron Works, Inc., 283 Pa.Super. 502, 424 A.2d 921, 927 (1981). Miller v. Sacred Heart Hosp., 753 A.2d 829, 832 (Pa.Super.2000) (internal citations omitted). "To the extent that the trial court's findings are predicated on errors of law, we review the court's findings de novo." John B. Conomos, Inc. v. Sun Co., Inc. (R & M), 831 A.2d 696, 704 (Pa.Super.2003), appeal denied, 577 Pa. 697, 845 A.2d 818 (2004). ¶ 25 In his first four issues, Appellant claims the parties entered into a contract for the construction of a 20.8 acre impoundment of water; the size of the impoundment was an essential term of the contract; Appellant conveyed 55 acres of real property to Appellees in exchange for $125,000.00; Appellant contributed $25,000.00 of the purchase price to the construction costs of the dam; and, Appellees agreed to construct a 20.8 acre impoundment at 1505 feet. Appellant avers Appellees breached the parties' contract when they unilaterally decided to reduce the size of the lake significantly, without telling Appellant about the change in plans. Appellant insists he should have been informed of the substantial change in plans to determine whether he wanted to proceed with the reduced impoundment. Appellant maintains Appellees failed to tell him that they could not obtain the permit from ACE for a 20.8 acre impoundment. Instead, Appellees used $25,000.00 of Appellant's funds, without his authorization or waiver, to construct a dam without a permit and an impoundment that was considerably smaller than agreed, to Appellees' primary benefit and to Appellant's measurable detriment. As a result of the breach, Appellant claims he incurred the following damages: Wetland Studies/Contour Maps $ 15,000.00 Cost of Dam $ 25,000.00 Lost Property Value of five (5) Lakefront lots $175,000.00 __________ Total $215,000.00 (Appellant's Brief at 30-31). Appellant also claims he incurred legal expenses in defending against Appellees' lawsuit as well as maintaining his counterclaims against Appellees. Appellant concludes the proper remedy in this case is to affirm the contract and remand for a determination on his breach of contract damages. ¶ 26 Appellant further submits the record does not support the trial court's decision to avoid the contract on the ground of mutual mistake of fact. Appellant insists Appellees knew, when they entered into their agreement with Appellant, that their permit to construct a 20.8 acre impoundment was no longer valid, but they failed to inform Appellant regarding the true status of their permit. Appellees knew their permit had expired. They also knew they could not construct a 20.8 acre impoundment under existing circumstances. Appellees had this information but Appellant did not. Therefore, Appellant reasons, Appellees cannot claim mutual mistake 332*332 of fact as a defense to the formation of the contract. Moreover, to the extent the court concluded the parties were mutually mistaken such that the contract was canceled, Appellant submits the court erred in failing to return the parties to their original position, as if there had been no contract. As such, Appellant claims he should get his land back as well as the $25,000.00 escrow fund used for the construction of the dam, and he should return the purchase price of the land to Appellees. Appellant concludes the court erred in avoiding the contract based upon mutual mistake; in the alternative, the court failed to provide the appropriate remedy under that circumstance. ¶ 27 Additionally, Appellant asserts Appellees wrongfully used the $25,000.00 in escrow to construct a dam without a permit to create a smaller impoundment, over his strict instructions to the contrary. Appellant concludes the court abused its discretion when it (1) ignored record evidence that Appellant had unequivocally conveyed his position on the project to Appellees and (2) failed to award $25,000.00 plus interest to Appellant. ¶ 28 Appellant further argues the parties' agreement contained an integration clause that stated the agreement could not be altered except in writing and by mutual consent of the parties. The contemplated impoundment of 20.8 acres was not created, and the parties did not enter into any written agreement to modify the terms of the original contract to accommodate a smaller impoundment. As a result of their unilateral modification, Appellees created a substantially smaller lake that primarily benefited them to Appellant's detriment. Appellees' conduct constituted a material breach of the parties' contract. Appellant submits the trial court abused its discretion when it found the smaller impoundment satisfied the parties' original agreement. For all of the foregoing reasons, Appellant concludes the court erred and abused its discretion when it denied him any relief on his breach of contract claim, and its decision must be reversed and the matter remanded for a determination of damages. We agree. ¶ 29 To successfully maintain a cause of action for breach of contract the plaintiff must establish: (1) the existence of a contract, including its essential terms, (2) a breach of a duty imposed by the contract, and (3) resultant damages. Gorski v. Smith, 812 A.2d 683 (Pa.Super.2002), appeal denied, 579 Pa. 692, 856 A.2d 834 (2004) (citing Corestates Bank, N.A. v. Cutillo, 723 A.2d 1053, 1058 (Pa.Super.1999)). Murphy v. Duquesne University Of The Holy Ghost, 565 Pa. 571, 591, 777 A.2d 418, 429 (2001) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). "In ascertaining the intent of the parties to a contract, it is their outward and objective manifestations of assent, as opposed to their undisclosed and subjective intentions, that matter." Espenshade v. Espenshade, 729 A.2d 1239, 1243 (Pa.Super.1999). Further, "specific, express written language is not necessary for a particular contractual intent to exist in an agreement. Rather, it is common for 333*333 the intent of contracting parties to be inherent in the totality of their contract." Murphy, supra at 596, 777 A.2d at 432. "In the absence of an express provision, the law will imply an agreement by the parties to a contract to do and perform those things that according to reason and justice they should do in order to carry out the purpose for which the contract was made and to refrain from doing anything that would destroy or injure the other party's right to receive the fruits of the contract." Slater v. Pearle Vision Center, Inc., 376 Pa.Super. 580, 546 A.2d 676, 679 (1988) (describing what is known as "doctrine of necessary implication"). "The meaning of an unambiguous written instrument presents a question of law for resolution by the court." Murphy, supra at 591, 777 A.2d at 430. ¶ 30 Pennsylvania courts regularly employ the Restatement (Second) of Contracts when resolving contract disputes. See Felix v. Giuseppe Kitchens & Baths, Inc., 848 A.2d 943 (Pa.Super.2004).[4] The doctrine of mutual mistake of fact serves as a defense to the formation of a contract and occurs when the parties to the contract have "an erroneous belief as to a basic assumption of the contract at the time of formation which will have a material effect on the agreed exchange as to either party." Bianchi v. Bianchi, 859 A.2d 511, 516 n. 3 (Pa.Super.2004). "A mutual mistake occurs when the written instrument fails to ... set forth the `true' agreement" of the parties. Daddona v. Thorpe, 749 A.2d 475, 487 (Pa.Super.2000), appeal denied, 563 Pa. 702, 761 A.2d 550 (2000). "[T]he language of the instrument should be interpreted in the light of the subject matter, the apparent object or purpose of the parties and the conditions existing when it was executed." Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ¶ 31 The Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 152 provides: Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 152 (1981). Under this section, Id. Comment: a. Rationale (emphasis added). See also Loyal Christian Ben. Ass'n v. Bender, 342 Pa.Super. 614, 493 A.2d 760, 762 (1985) (stating "If this tripartite test is met, the injured party may acquire reformation of the contract or... avoid the contractual obligations"). ¶ 32 A contract entered into under a mutual misconception as to an essential element of fact may be rescinded or reformed upon the discovery of the mistake if (1) the misconception entered into the contemplation of both parties as a condition of assent, and (2) the parties can be placed in their former position regarding the subject matter of the contract. Gocek v. Gocek, 417 Pa.Super. 406, 612 A.2d 1004, 1006 (1992). In other words, mutual mistake occurs when a fact in existence at the time of the formation of the contract, but unknown to both parties, will materially affect the parties' performance of the contract. Loyal Christian Ben. Ass'n, supra. ¶ 33 Section 154 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts provides: Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 154 (1981). "The rule stated in this Section determines whether a party bears the risk of a mistake for purposes of [Sections] 152 and 153." Id. Comment: a. Rationale. "Even though a mistaken party does not bear the risk of a mistake, he may be barred from avoidance if the mistake was the result of his failure to act in good faith and in accordance with reasonable standards of fair dealing." Id. Ehrenzeller v. Chubb, 171 Pa.Super. 460, 90 A.2d 286, 287 (1952). ¶ 34 Additionally, Pennsylvania law recognizes the doctrine of frustration of contractual purpose or "impracticability of performance" as a valid defense to performance under a contract. Alvino v. Carraccio, 400 Pa. 477, 482, 162 A.2d 358, 361 (1960); Ellwood City Forge Corp. v. Fort Worth Heat Treating Co., Inc., 431 Pa.Super. 240, 636 A.2d 219, 222 (1994). The Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 261 provides: 335*335 Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 261 (1981). Additionally, Section 264 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts states: Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 264 (1981). Our Supreme Court has explained: Greek Catholic Congregation of Borough of Olyphant v. Plummer, 338 Pa. 373, 382, 12 A.2d 435, 439 (1940) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). ¶ 35 Once impracticability of performance or frustration of purpose occurs, "it is up to the parties to waive the difficulties or seek to terminate the agreement." Ellwood, supra at 223. If a party proceeds under the original contract, despite the impracticability that would otherwise justify his non-performance, and is then unable to perform as previously agreed, he can be liable for damages. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 261 (1981). On the other hand, a party who has already performed under a contract, which is dissolved on the ground of supervening impracticability, is generally allowed a claim for restitution to the extent his performance has benefited the other party. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 272 Comment: b. Relief including restitution. "In a proper case recovery may go beyond mere restitution and include elements of reliance by the claimant, even though they have not benefited the other party." Id. (referencing Section 377 of Restatement (Second) of Contracts). Under the proper circumstances, "If both parties have rendered some performance, each is entitled to restitution against the other." Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 377. ¶ 36 In the instant case, the parties' February 1993 agreement provided that Appellees would buy and Appellant would sell approximately 55 acres of unimproved land from Appellant's property, which was comprised of 107 acres in Susquehanna County. The "Earl Lorah Plan" attached to the agreement, specifically incorporated by reference and made a part thereof, allots on the drawing approximately 25 acres to an impoundment of water. Consideration for the sale was set forth in the agreement as follows: (Agreement for the Sale of Real Estate, February 1993, at 1-3; R.R. at 11a-13a) (emphasis added). The Agreement further provided: (Id. at 5-7; R.R. at 15a-17a) (emphasis added). ¶ 37 With respect to Appellant's breach of contract claim, the trial court reasoned Appellant did not produce enough evidence to prove Appellees breached the parties' agreement, because "The Agreement does not provide any remedy for [Appellees'] and [Appellant's] mistaken belief that their Agreement, and not [ACE] would be the final authority on the size of the impoundment." See Trial Court Opinion at 9. This conclusion is not supported by the evidence of record or Appellees' own admissions in their pleadings.[5] To the contrary, the record makes 337*337 clear that the parties' agreement was for an impoundment of approximately 20.8 acres. The agreement was specifically contingent on ACE approval and Appellees' ability to obtain the proper permits for the dam and the impoundment, as described in the "Earl Lorah Plan" that was incorporated into the parties' agreement by reference. Appellees also admitted in their original pleading that the parties intended a 20.8 acre impoundment and that Appellees bore the responsibility for obtaining the proper permits to construct that impoundment. The record further demonstrates Appellees knew for several years before the agreement that the permits they had were in dispute. Appellees simply did not follow through in resolving the ACE permit dispute in a manner favorable to the agreement. Despite the court's credibility determination that Appellees did not know definitively about the finality of the permits before they entered into the agreement with Appellant, we conclude Appellees bore the risk that their beliefs were incorrect and cannot use their own mistake to escape their contractual obligations to Appellant. Therefore, the court erred as a matter of law when it excused Appellees on the basis of mutual mistake of fact. See Loyal Christian Ben. Ass'n, supra. ¶ 38 The court's conclusion, that ACE would be the final authority on the size of the impoundment, is more in the nature of "frustration of purpose," not "mutual mistake of fact." In September 1993, Appellees' performance was made impracticable by having to comply with a governmental regulation, the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 264 (1981). This occurrence constituted a valid defense to performance under the parties' agreement. See Alvino, supra. It was then up to Appellees to obtain Appellant's waiver or to seek to terminate the contract, before Appellees moved forward with construction of a smaller lake. See Ellwood, supra. Appellees did not even inform Appellant of the changed circumstances. Instead, Appellees unilaterally decided to create a substantially smaller impoundment to their considerable benefit and Appellant's obvious detriment. Therefore, Appellees must bear the consequences of their unilateral decision. Appellees proceeded under the parties' original contract, despite the impracticability that would have otherwise justified their non-performance, and were unable to perform as previously agreed. Thus, Appellees can be liable for damages. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 261 (1981). ¶ 39 On the other hand, Appellant had already performed under the parties' agreement and should be allowed a claim for restitution to the extent his performance has benefited Appellees. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 272 Comment: b. Relief including restitution. Thus, Appellant is entitled to damages in the form of restitution to the extent his performance prior to Appellees' breach benefited Appellees, and his damages may go beyond mere restitution to include losses stemming from Appellant's reliance on the contract, even if those losses did not directly benefit Appellees (for example, the loss in property value of Appellant's lakefront lots as a result of construction of the smaller lake). See generally Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 272 (1981). ¶ 40 Moreover, Appellant's May 15, 1993 letter, informing Appellees they were to 338*338 use his money to build a dam only in connection with the construction of a 20.8 acre impoundment as agreed to by the parties, did not constitute an attempted modification of the parties' original agreement. A careful review of the terms of the parties' agreement demonstrates the dam was to be completed only for 20+ acre impoundment of water. (See Agreement for the Sale of Real Estate, February 1993; R.R. at 11a-16a.) The parties' agreement did not authorize Appellees to build a dam large enough to support the intended impoundment, separate and apart from or regardless of the eventual size of the impoundment. The written agreement makes clear that the construction of the dam was integrally related to and authorized for only the size of the intended impoundment. Appellant's May 1993 letter merely reiterated the parties' agreement.[6] Accordingly, we respectfully reverse the court's decision in favor of Appellees on the ground of mutual mistake and remand this matter to the trial court for a full determination of Appellant's damages, because the trial court made no findings as to damages. See generally Birth Center v. St. Paul Companies, Inc., 567 Pa. 386, 787 A.2d 376 (2001) (stating purpose of damages in contract actions is to return parties to position they would have been in but for breach); Harman v. Chambers, 358 Pa. 516, 57 A.2d 842 (1948) (stating, "Generally speaking, the measure of damages applicable in a case of breach of contract is that the aggrieved party should be placed as nearly as possible in the same position he would have occupied had there been no breach. In other words, he is entitled to be reimbursed for the money actually paid out and for all reasonable and proper expenses incurred on the faith of the contract."); Reformed Church of Ascension v. Theodore Hooven & Sons, Inc., 764 A.2d 1106 (Pa.Super.2000) (stating, "The policy behind contract law is to protect the parties' expectation interests by putting the aggrieved party in as good a position as he would have been had the contract been performed."). ¶ 41 In issues five, six and seven, Appellant maintains Appellees engaged in fraudulent conduct to induce Appellant to enter into the parties' agreement. Specifically, Appellant contends Appellees knew or should have known they could not fulfill their part of the contract but nevertheless intentionally misled him to believe they could. Appellant argues Appellees were privy to certain information, before the agreement was signed, regarding the probability that they could not create a 20.8 acre impoundment and that ACE was requesting plans for a scaled-down project. Appellant claims Appellees did nothing to resolve ACE's reservations before they initiated the agreement with Appellant. Instead, Appellees affirmatively represented to Appellant there would be no problem getting ACE approval for construction of the 20.8 acre lake. Appellant argues Appellees withheld this information for the specific purpose of inducing Appellant to enter into the parties' agreement and sell them 55 acres of prime realty at a reduced price. Appellant asserts he would not have entered into the parties' contract but for Appellees' "fraudulent representations" that they had a valid permit from ACE. Appellant asserts the record irrefutably demonstrates Appellees committed fraud in the inducement. 339*339 ¶ 42 Further, Appellant directs our attention to instances of Appellees' alleged "wanton" conduct following the formation of the parties' contract. For example, Appellant complains Appellees proceeded to construct a dam without a valid permit; used his funds to construct a smaller impoundment to benefit their property, including the land acquired from Appellant, without regard to Appellant's rights under the contract or the devaluation of his property; and instituted a frivolous lawsuit against Appellant for breach of contract upon the false premise that they would have completed the project as called for in the parties' agreement, but for Appellant's failure to move certain utility poles. Essentially, Appellant asserts Appellees committed fraud in the performance of the contract. Appellant concludes the trial court's decision must be reversed and the matter remanded for a determination of damages on his fraud claims. Appellant also alleges Appellees' conduct was so egregious as to support his claim for punitive damages. Appellant maintains the court erred in dismissing this claim as well. We disagree with Appellant's contentions. ¶ 43 Appellant's fraudulent inducement and fraudulent performance claims implicate the following principles.[7] Pittsburgh Const. Co. v. Griffith, 834 A.2d 572, 581-82 (Pa.Super.2003), appeal denied, 578 Pa. 701, 852 A.2d 313 (2004) (quoting eToll, Inc. v. Elias/Savion Advertising, Inc., 811 A.2d 10, 14 (Pa.Super.2002)) (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added). Id. at 15 (internal citations omitted). Id. at 19 (internal quotation marks omitted). Where fraud claims are intertwined with breach of contract claims and the duties allegedly breached are created and grounded in the contract itself, the gist of the action is breach of contract. Id. at 18. Thus, claims of fraud in the performance of a contract are generally barred under the gist of the action doctrine. Id. at 17. ¶ 44 Likewise, fraud-in-the-inducement claims are commonly barred if the contract at issue is fully integrated.[8] Blumenstock, supra. The rationale for this rule of law is "that a party cannot justifiably rely upon prior oral representations" and then sign a contract containing terms that refute the alleged prior oral representations. Id. at 1036. Thus, when "prior fraudulent oral misrepresentations are alleged regarding a subject that was specifically dealt with in a written contract, the party alleging such representations must, under the parol evidence rule, also aver that the representations were fraudulently or by accident or mistake omitted from the integrated written contract." HCB Contractors v. Liberty Place Hotel Associates, 539 Pa. 395, 398, 652 A.2d 1278, 1279 (1995). "To require less would make a mockery of the parol evidence rule because all a party would have to do to avoid, modify or nullify [a contract] would be to aver that false representations were `fraudulently' made." Nicolella v. Palmer, 432 Pa. 502, 507, 248 A.2d 20, 23 (1968). ¶ 45 In other words, Blumenstock, supra at 1036 (internal citations omitted). "The effect of an integration clause is to make the parol evidence rule particularly applicable. Thus the written contract, if unambiguous, must be held to express all of the negotiations, conversations, and agreements made prior to its execution, and neither oral testimony, nor prior written agreements, or other writings, are admissible to explain or vary the terms of the contract." 1726 Cherry Street Partnership by 1726 Cherry Street Corp. v. Bell Atlantic Properties, Inc., 439 Pa.Super. 141, 653 A.2d 663, 665 (1995), appeal denied, 544 Pa. 647, 664 A.2d 976 (1995). ¶ 46 In the instant case, Appellant's claims of fraud in the performance of the contract are integrally related to his breach of contract claims. The performance duties arose solely from the contract between the parties and were created and grounded in the contract itself. Further, these claims essentially duplicate Appellant's breach of contract claim and the success of his fraud-in-the-performance claims is wholly dependent on the terms of a contract. See Pittsburgh Const. Co., supra; eToll, Inc., supra. Thus, Appellant's fraud in the performance claims are barred under the gist of the action doctrine, because they are collateral to the contract, which is the main cause of action. See id. ¶ 47 With respect to Appellant's fraud-in-the-inducement claim, we note the parties' contract contains an integration clause. (See Agreement for the Sale of Real Estate ¶ 10. ENTIRETY; R.R. at 17a.) The agreement was fundamentally contingent on governmental agency approval. Thus, Appellant cannot claim he justifiably relied upon the alleged prior oral representations, where he signed a contract containing terms that arguably conflict with these alleged prior representations. See H.C.B. Contractors, supra. Moreover, Appellant failed to aver that the alleged prior oral representations were fraudulently omitted from the integrated written contract. If Appellees affirmatively represented to Appellant that there would be no problem getting ACE approval for construction of the 20.8 acre lake, and that representation was a material inducement to obtain Appellant's assent to the project, that assertion should have been included in the agreement. See LeDonne v. Kessler, 256 Pa.Super. 280, 389 A.2d 1123 (1978) (citing Bardwell v. Willis Co., 375 Pa. 503, 100 A.2d 102 (1953)) (stating where party asserts he relied on understandings, promises or representations made prior to execution of written contract, party should have protected himself by incorporating into written agreement those understandings, promises or representations upon which he now relies). Therefore, under the parol evidence rule, Appellant's fraud-in-the-inducement claims are barred as well. See HCB Contractors, supra; Blumenstock, supra; 1726 Cherry Street Partnership, supra. ¶ 48 Consistent with the cited principles of law, there is no reason to disturb the trial court's rejection of Appellant's fraud claims. See Pittsburgh Const. Co., supra; eToll, Inc., supra. See also HCB Contractors, supra; Blumenstock, supra. Due to our disposition of the appeal, we likewise affirm the trial court's denial of Appellant's prayer for punitive damages. See Baker v. Pennsylvania National Mutual Casualty Insurance Company, 370 Pa.Super. 461, 536 A.2d 1357 (1988), aff'd, 522 Pa. 80, 559 A.2d 914 (1989) (stating punitive damages are not recoverable merely for breach of contract). 342*342 ¶ 49 In his final issue, Appellant argues Appellees' original lawsuit against him was arbitrary, vexatious, and in bad faith. Appellant claims Appellees' action falsely contended that the reduction in size of the impoundment was Appellant's fault, in an effort to cast the responsibility of the failed project on Appellant. Appellant points to several factors in support of his position: (1) Appellant specified he did not want an impoundment less than 20.8 acres; (2) Appellees unilaterally applied for a permit to create an impoundment of 12.4 acres that did not implicate the utility poles; (3) ACE did not require the utility poles to be moved; (4) ACE did not indicate that it would authorize a larger impoundment if the utility poles were removed; and (5) ACE did not raise the utility poles as a potential problem with the impoundment. Appellant maintains Appellees' lawsuit was wholly predicated upon false assertions that he, not Appellees, were at fault. Appellant concludes he is entitled his attorney's fees related to the defense of Appellees' lawsuit. We agree with Appellant, but only to the extent that this claim should be considered on remand. ¶ 50 Generally, litigants are responsible for their own counsel fees unless otherwise permitted by statutory authority, agreement of the parties, or some other recognized exception to the general rule. Chatham Communications, Inc. v. General Press Corp., 463 Pa. 292, 344 A.2d 837 (1975). A trial court may award counsel fees to a party when that party's opponent acts in a dilatory, obdurate or vexatious manner during the pendency of the case. 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 2503. The statute provides: 42 Pa.C.S.A. § 2503(9). Thunberg v. Strause, 545 Pa. 607, 615-16, 682 A.2d 295, 299 (1996) (internal citations omitted). The amount of counsel fees allowed is within the discretion of the trial court, whose opportunities are necessarily [*] Judge Cavanaugh did not participate in this decision. [1] Evidence at trial indicated the dam was constructed at a height of 1505.1 feet and the actual impoundment is approximately 14.8 acres. Even at this size, Appellant maintained the impoundment does not benefit his property, and the impoundment might be subject to reduction as it exceeds the permit specifications. [2] Ordinarily, an appeal properly lies from the entry of judgment, not from the order denying post-trial motions. See generally Johnston the Florist, Inc. v. TEDCO Constr. Corp., 441 Pa.Super. 281, 657 A.2d 511, 516 (1995) (stating appeal to Superior Court lies from judgments entered subsequent to trial court's disposition of post-verdict motions, not from order denying post-trial motions). A final judgment entered during the pendency of an appeal is sufficient to perfect appellate jurisdiction. Drum v. Shaull Equipment and Supply, Co., 787 A.2d 1050 (Pa.Super.2001), appeal denied, 569 Pa. 693, 803 A.2d 735 (2002). Here, Appellant filed his notice of appeal on June 11, 2003, prior to the entry of judgment. At Appellant's behest, judgment was entered on August 19, 2003. Thus, Appellant's notice of appeal relates forward to August 19, 2003, the date judgment was entered. See Pa.R.A.P. 905(a) (stating notice of appeal filed after court's determination but before entry of appealable order shall be treated as filed after such entry and on day of entry). Hence, there are no procedural/jurisdictional impediments to our review of this appeal. [3] The "public" notices referenced in this case are not for the public at large. They are technical and involve various governmental agencies. [4] In its decision to deny Appellant relief on his breach of contract claim, the trial court employed a combination of two legal doctrines, mutual mistake of fact and "frustration of purpose" or "impracticability of performance." See Trial Court Opinion, filed July 11, 2002, at 9. [5] We note Appellees did not at any time plead the affirmative defense of mutual mistake of fact. Appellees raised this defense for the first time in their post-trial brief. However, Appellant responded to the defense on the merits and failed to argue waiver. As such, Appellant himself waived any waiver argument on his own behalf. [6] Appellees did not file a brief on appeal. In their post-trial brief, however, they argued the parties did not really agree on an exact size of the intended impoundment, which in and of itself constituted a mutual mistake of fact. We reject that contention, where the record and agreement as a whole makes clear the parties contemplated an impoundment of at least 20 acres. [7] "Fraud is a generic term used to describe anything calculated to deceive, whether by a single act or combination, or by suppression of the truth, or suggestion of what is false, whether it be by direct falsehood or by innuendo, by speech or silence, word of mouth, or look or gesture." Blumenstock v. Gibson, 811 A.2d 1029, 1034 (Pa.Super.2003), appeal denied, 573 Pa. 714, 828 A.2d 349 (2003). To prove fraud, a plaintiff must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence: (1) a representation; (2) which is material to the transaction at hand; (3) made falsely, with knowledge of its falsity or recklessness as to whether it is true or false; (4) with the intent of misleading another into relying on it; (5) justifiable reliance on the misrepresentation; and (6) the resulting injury was proximately caused by the reliance. Unsupported assertions and conclusory accusations cannot create genuine issues of material fact as to the existence of fraud. Id. (internal citations omitted).

[8] An exception to this rule has been carved out for "real estate inspection cases," which involve written agreements for the sale of real property, almost always residential, even though they contain integration clauses. Blumenstock, supra. The exception does not apply to the present case. Save trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.
