In re Alex C., 13 A. 3d 347 - NH: Supreme Court 2010 In re ALEX C. Supreme Court of New Hampshire. 348*348 Michael A. Delaney, attorney general (Thomas E. Bocian, assistant attorney general, on the brief and orally), for the State. Pamela E. Phelan, assistant appellate defender, of Concord, on the brief and orally, for the juvenile. BRODERICK, C.J. The juvenile, Alex C., appeals the ruling of the Trial Court (Runyon, J.) finding the delinquency petition true, see RSA 169-B:6, :16 (Supp.2009). We affirm. The following facts are undisputed. On the evening of February 27, 2009, Rachel K.'s daughter ran away from home. The next day, in an effort to locate her daughter, Rachel K. called friends and contacted the police. Using her daughter's password on her home computer, Rachel K. also logged in to her daughter's AOL Instant Message (AIM) account. Using her daughter's screen name of "hey Nicci hey," Rachel K. indicated that her daughter was available to communicate with her friends. She believed that one of her daughter's friends might respond with information that would help locate her daughter. At approximately 10:30 a.m., the juvenile, using the screen name "skaterboy," sent an instant message to "hey Nicci hey." Rachel K. responded with a single instant message of "Hey"; the instant message exchange then ended without incident. At approximately 11:00 a.m., the juvenile, now using the screen name "the kaboomroom95" again contacted "hey Nicci hey." He initially believed that he was communicating with Rachel K.'s daughter. After "hey Nicci hey" inquired who he was, the juvenile realized that Rachel K. was using her daughter's screen name and the following instant messages were sent: After this last instant message, a forty-six minute break occurred, during which neither Rachel K. nor the juvenile typed an instant message or logged off from their AIM accounts. Beginning at 12:14:59 p.m. and ending at 12:15:36 p.m. — a period of thirty-seven seconds — the juvenile typed the phrase "fats***" and sent it to "hey Nicci hey" seventeen separate times. As the juvenile hit the "return" key in between typing each phrase on his computer keyboard, the phrase appeared as seventeen separate entries in the instant messaging window on Rachel K.'s home computer. Less than a minute later, at 12:16:00 p.m., the juvenile typed the phrase "stuppppid c***" and sent it to "hey Nicci hey." For approximately four minutes more, until 12:20:23 p.m., the juvenile sent an additional twenty-one instant messages; Rachel K. responded with seven instant messages of her own. At 12:20:23 p.m., the juvenile sent a final instant message of "peace faggot" to "hey Nicci hey" before logging off from his AIM account at 12:23:00 p.m. Alleging that the juvenile had committed the offense of harassment, see RSA 644:4, I(b) (2007), the delinquency petition stated: At the close of the adjudicatory hearing, the juvenile moved to dismiss the petition, arguing that the instant messaging "conversation between him and [Rachel K.]" constituted "one communication," and, therefore, his conduct did not fall within the harassment statute's proscription against "repeated communications." After hearing arguments and reviewing the parties' memoranda of law, the trial court issued a written order ruling that all of the elements of the harassment charge had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and finding the petition true. This appeal followed. On appeal, the juvenile contends that the trial court erred in finding that his conduct constituted "repeated communications" within the meaning of RSA 644:4, I(b). Specifically, he argues that a "plain reading" of RSA 644:4, I(b) "indicates that the statute prohibits a pattern of separate instant message conversations, not multiple comments made within a single AIM conversation. The State's reading of the statute to the contrary leads to an absurd and unjust result that is not supported by the legislative intent and the cases narrowly construing the statute." (Emphasis added.) Here, the trial court construed RSA 644:4, I(b), a question of law; consequently, we review its ruling de novo. See State v. Brown, 155 N.H. 590, 591, 927 A.2d 493 (2007). State v. Gubitosi, 157 N.H. 720, 723-24, 958 A.2d 962 (2008) (citations omitted). If a statute is ambiguous, we will consider legislative history to aid our analysis. State v. Dansereau, 157 N.H. 596, 598, 956 A.2d 310 (2008). We construe provisions of the Criminal Code "according to the fair import of their terms and to promote justice." RSA 625:3 (2007). RSA 644:4, I(b) provides: The juvenile acknowledges that the pertinent language in his instant messages to Rachel K. was "profane." He does not contest that it was "offensively coarse," and he has not argued that he had any purpose other than to annoy Rachel K. Consequently, the sole question on appeal is whether the juvenile's twenty instant messages, sent to Rachel K. between 11:20 a.m. and 12:16 p.m. in offensively coarse language with the purpose to annoy her, were "repeated communications" under RSA 644:4, I(b). In order to provide a context for our statutory analysis, we first consider the nature of an instant message and how "instant messaging" works. Our review illustrates that courts have used a variety of terms to describe this relatively recent development in electronic communications technology; those descriptions may or may not differentiate between an instant message and the process of instant messaging. For example: Maxwell v. State, 168 Md.App. 1, 895 A.2d 327, 328-29 n. 1 (2006) (quotations omitted). People v. Jensen, 114 Cal.App.4th 224, 7 Cal.Rptr.3d 609, 612 n. 1 (2003). 351*351 Kerber v. Dairy Queen Operators Assn., No. C9-02-1883, 2003 WL 21694395, at *1 n. 1 (Minn.Ct.App. July 22, 2003). For our own part, we have indicated that instant messaging is an application providing for online conversation between individuals by way of their computers and the internet. Individuals may participate in the instant messaging conversation by transmitting and receiving discrete, self-contained instant messages. Specifically: State v. Lott, 152 N.H. 436, 437, 879 A.2d 1167 (2005) (quotation and brackets omitted). RSA 644:4 does not define either the term "repeated" or the phrase "repeated communications," as used in RSA 644:4, I(b). The plain and ordinary meanings of "repeated" include "renewed or recurring again and again: CONSTANT, FREQUENT... said, done, or presented again...." Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1924 (unabridged ed.2002). RSA 644:4, II (2007) does, however, define the term "communicates" for the purposes of RSA 644:4, I. Specifically: (Emphases added.) The juvenile does not dispute that he communicated with Rachel K. by way of a computer. Consequently, we believe it reasonable to say that the plain and ordinary meaning of "repeated communications," within the overall context of RSA 644:4, is the renewed, frequent, or constant imparting of a message by any method of transmission. See also Webster's, supra at 460 (definition of "communication" includes "the act or action of imparting or transmitting"). Here, over the course of fifty-six minutes, from 11:20 a.m. to 12:16 p.m., the juvenile composed twenty separate instant messages and, using the keyboard of his computer, typed them into his instant messaging application. After typing an instant message, he sent it from his computer to that of Rachel K., where the message he had just imparted was available for her to read. The juvenile repeated this action twenty times. We fail to see how the juvenile's repeated instant message communications do not fit squarely within the actions proscribed by the plain language of the statute. In contending that RSA 644:4, I(b) "prohibits the act of initiating successive communications[, but] does not concern itself with each statement made during a single communication," the juvenile argues: 352*352 While we might agree with the juvenile's premise concerning successive and single communications, we disagree that a single conversation necessarily equates to a single communication, or even that an instant message conversation is particularly like a telephone conversation. Instead, we view instant messaging as the direct technological progeny of e-mailing. As such, we consider the process of instant messaging, not necessarily as some monolithic entity — a single conversation, but as a series of discrete electronic messages between two or more individuals. As in the case of e-mail, the sender composes each instant message on a computer keyboard; the sender physically triggers each instant message to be sent by one computer and received by another via the internet; and the recipient may then read each instant message on a computer screen. While sending an instant message may invite a response, and may even initiate an instant messaging conversation, it does not necessarily have to do so. In that sense, we believe that an instant message is similar, not to a telephone conversation, but to a telephone call that reaches an answering machine instead of the ear of the telephone call's intended recipient. In both cases, a message has been imparted. Cf. Lott, 152 N.H. at 441, 879 A.2d 1167 (explaining that, like an e-mail message and a message left on an answering machine, the recording of the instant message is necessary for the intended recipient of that message to read it; further, the sending of an e-mail or chat-room communication is analogous to leaving a message on an answering machine). Further, we believe that an instant messaging conversation and a telephone conversation differ significantly. In a telephone conversation, two (or more) individuals can simultaneously speak directly with, and listen to, each other. Such conversation entails the near instantaneous imparting and receiving of oral messages; parties often speak simultaneously, with one person talking over or cutting off the other's speech in mid-sentence. Unlike an instant messaging conversation, a telephone conversation's substance is not composed, physically typed on a computer keyboard, electronically sent to another computer, and made available for another person to read, comprehend, and possibly respond. Indeed, the particular facts of this case serve to further underscore the differences. While a fifty-six minute telephone call between two people might not be uncommon, we think that a forty-six minute break during that call strains the meaning of "conversation." To the extent that the juvenile argues that our plain meaning analysis of the statute is not supported by our decision in Gubitosi, we disagree. Gubitosi involved the appeal of a defendant's conviction for harassment under RSA 644:4, I(b) after he made repeated telephone calls to the victim, at varying times of day, including late at night, often leaving messages that the victim considered progressively more harassing and frightening. Gubitosi, 157 N.H. at 722, 958 A.2d 962. The defendant unsuccessfully challenged RSA 644:4, I(b) as unconstitutionally overbroad. We held that the scope of the statute was narrowly tailored to the illegal communications sought to be prevented. Gubitosi, 157 N.H. at 728, 958 A.2d 962. In distinguishing RSA 644:4, I(b) from subsections I(a) and I(f) that we had earlier found unconstitutional in State v. Brobst, 151 N.H. 420, 424, 857 A.2d 1253 (2004), and State v. Pierce, 152 N.H. 790, 793, 887 A.2d 132 (2005), we stated: Gubitosi, 157 N.H. at 728, 958 A.2d 962 (citation and quotations omitted). There was no issue in Gubitosi of the defendant being prosecuted under RSA 644:4, I(b) for making multiple statements ("repeated communications") within a single telephone call or telephone message, and we see no conflict between our construction of the statute here and our decision in Gubitosi. Indirectly arguing that the meaning of RSA 644:4, I(b) is ambiguous, the juvenile cites certain legislative history of the harassment statute and invokes the rule of lenity as requiring a construction of the statute favorable to him. We have previously noted that: Dansereau, 157 N.H. at 602, 956 A.2d 310 (citation and quotations omitted). As noted earlier, we will consider legislative history to aid our statutory analysis if a statute is ambiguous. Id. at 598, 956 A.2d 310. In this case, however, we find no ambiguity in the statute. Instead, we have found it reasonable that the plain and ordinary meaning of "repeated communications," within the overall context of RSA 644:4, is the renewed, frequent, or constant imparting of a message by any method of transmission. Consequently, the rule of lenity is inapplicable in this case and we need not review the statute's legislative history. Cf. id. at 603, 956 A.2d 310 (rule of lenity applied, and ambiguity resolved in favor of defendant, where neither the statute's language nor legislative history clearly established what the legislature intended by statutory phrase). Even if we were to consider the statute's legislative history, however, we would not agree with the juvenile's argument that it indicates RSA 644:4, I(b) was designed to reach only "conduct amounting to a `repeated course of calls,'" and not his conduct. The juvenile first looks to the Model Penal Code. We have recognized that our Criminal Code is largely derived from the Model Penal Code; we have, therefore, looked to the Model Penal Code and its Commentaries when interpreting analogous New Hampshire statutes. State v. Lamy, 158 N.H. 511, 515, 969 A.2d 451 (2009). RSA 644:4, I(b) is substantially similar to section 250.4(3) of the Model Penal Code. See Model Penal Code § 250.4(3), at 360 (Official Draft and Revised Comments 1980). The juvenile cites Comment 2 as providing that section 250.4(3) was intended to address only a "pattern of harassment." Comment 2 makes clear that although the "principal application" of § 250.4(3) is telephone calls, the section is not limited to the same. Id. cmt. 2, at 360. Comment 2 is dated nearly two decades before the New Hampshire legislature amended RSA 644:4 to include a separate proscription against harassment by computer. In addition, the Model Penal Code text was adopted in 1962; the Commentaries were last published in 1980. With both dates coming well before the widespread use of instant messages, the value of the Model Penal Code and Commentaries to construe RSA 644:4, I(b) with regard to a communications technology that was little known at the time of their publication is minimal. 354*354 The juvenile next points to the statute's legislative history. In 1999, the definition of "communicates" in RSA 644:4, II was amended to amplify that imparting a message "by any method of transmission" specifically includes "electronic transmissions generated or communicated via a computer." Laws 1999, 141:1. We believe that the legislative history of the amendment supports a broader proscription than simply prohibiting multiple harassing e-mails, as argued by the juvenile. House Bill (HB) 345-FN (proposing the language of the amendment) was entitled an Act "relative to harassment via the computer." N.H.H. R. Jour. 302 (March 30, 1999). In support of the bill's passage, Representative Flora for the House Committee on Criminal Justice and Public Safety, stated: Id. (emphases added). In legislative history provided by the juvenile, the Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony from Representative Stone, the bill's prime sponsor, who stated: Senate Comm. on Judiciary, Hr'g on HB 345-FN (May 19, 1999). At the same hearing, Representative Dolan, a co-sponsor of the bill, stated: Id. In support of the bill's passage, Senator Trombly stated: N.H.S. Jour. 1122-23 (May 27, 1999). In sum, we believe the statute's legislative history indicates an intent to provide for a broad proscription against harassment via the internet, the electronic transmissions of computers, and the technological advances therein. Given our construction of RSA 644:4, I(b), we find no error on the part of the trial court. Of course, if the legislature did not intend this interpretation of RSA 644:4, I(b), it is free to amend the statute as it sees fit. See, e.g., State v. McKeown, 159 N.H. 434, 438, 986 A.2d 583 (2009). Affirmed. DALIANIS, DUGGAN, HICKS and CONBOY, JJ., concurred. Save trees - read court opinions online on Google Scholar.
