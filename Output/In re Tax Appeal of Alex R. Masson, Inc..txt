In re Tax Appeal of Alex R. Masson, Inc., 21 Kan. App. 2d 863 - Kan: Court of Appeals 1995 In the Matter of the Appeal of ALEX R. MASSON, INC., from an Assessment of Retailers' Sales Tax. Court of Appeals of Kansas. Gregory D. Kincaid, of Olathe, for appellant. Richard Oxandale, general counsel, and Ronald H. Grant, of Kansas Department of Revenue, for appellee. 864*864 Before RULON, P.J., MARQUARDT, J., and E. NEWTON VICKERS, District Judge Retired, assigned. RULON, J.: Alex R. Masson, Inc., petitioner, appeals a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals (BOTA) affirming the Kansas Department of Revenue's ruling that petitioner is not entitled to a sales tax exemption pursuant to K.S.A. 79-3606. We must decide if the growing, cultivation, and selling of ornamental plants by a commercial greenhouse is an agricultural pursuit under K.S.A. 79-3606. We reverse and remand. The facts in this case are not in dispute and are as follows: Petitioner is a greenhouse operation which grows tropical foliage and flowering plants for decorative purposes. Petitioner's produce is sold through grocery stores and other mass marketers. In 1992, the Kansas Department of Revenue (KDR) issued a retailers' sales tax and consumers' compensating use tax assessment against petitioner in the amounts of $28,511 and $14,135, respectively, plus interest and penalties. Petitioner appealed to the Director of Taxation, and an administrative law judge (ALJ) upheld KDR's assessments. Ultimately, BOTA upheld the ALJ's order. STANDARD OF REVIEW The issue presented to us involves the interpretation of Kansas statutes and regulations and is a question of law. Final determinations of questions of law rest with the court. See Hixon v. Lario Enterprises, Inc., 257 Kan. 377, 382, 892 P.2d 507 (1995). AGRICULTURAL USE The questions in this case are what constitutes an agricultural use and whether petitioner's purchases of natural gas, electricity, and farm machinery are exempt from the Kansas sales and compensating use taxes. The relevant statute in this case is K.S.A. 79-3603, which read in relevant part: .... K.S.A. 79-3703 read in relevant part: K.S.A. 79-3606 read in relevant part: .... .... K.A.R. 92-19-39 reads: K.A.R. 92-19-13 reads in relevant part: Petitioner argues the above regulations are overly restrictive and KDR has substituted its judgment of what constitutes agricultural purposes for that of the legislature. KDR argues that its regulations have the force and effect of law and, therefore, absent a finding the regulation is unconstitutional, this court should uphold its interpretation. In Kansas, K.S.A. 79-3618 provides the Secretary of Revenue the authority to adopt such rules and regulations as may be necessary to enforce the Kansas Retailers' Sales Tax Act. Similarly, K.S.A. 79-3707 gives the Secretary the power to adopt rules and regulations for the administration of the Kansas Compensating Use Tax Act. However, the power to adopt and promulgate rules and regulations is an administrative and not a legislative power. To be valid, a regulation must come within the authority conferred by statute, and a regulation which goes beyond that which the legislature has authorized or which extends the source of its legislative power is void. Kansas 868*868 Human Rights Comm'n v. Topeka Golf Ass'n, 18 Kan. App.2d 581, Syl. ¶ 2, 856 P.2d 515 (1993), aff'd 254 Kan. 767, 869 P.2d 631 (1994). Kansas law is well settled that one who seeks exemption from a tax bears the burden of showing it comes within the specific provisions of the statute providing for the exemption. See Director of Taxation v. Kansas Krude Oil Reclaiming Co., 236 Kan. 450, 454, 691 P.2d 1303 (1984). KDR argues that because petitioner's business does not qualify as an agricultural use as defined by regulation, petitioner is not entitled to the claimed exemption. This argument is circular. The question is whether the regulation is a further restriction than that provided by statute. Clearly, "[t]axation is the power by which the State raises money to defray the necessary expenses of government for a public purpose." 236 Kan. 450. The legislature has the power to express what property shall be taxed and what property will be exempt. 236 Kan. at 454. Unquestionably, The narrow question presented is whether a wholesale greenhouse operation can be defined as an agricultural use or farming. Neither the current Retailers' Sales Tax Act nor the current Compensating Use Tax Act define the terms "farming" or "agricultural use." Other tax statutes do give definitions that may be helpful in ascertaining the legislative intent. K.S.A. 79-1476 defined "land devoted to agricultural use" as According to Black's Law Dictionary 68 (6th ed. 1990), agriculture is defined as "[t]he science or art of cultivating the soil, harvesting crops, and raising livestock and also as the science or art of the production of plants and animals useful to man and in varying degrees the preparation of such products for man's use and their disposal." Consequently, common sense leads us to the conclusion the products grown by petitioner fall within the definition of an agricultural use as defined by K.S.A. 79-1476. In this jurisdiction, Additionally, "[w]hen separate statutes relate to the same subject matter and class of things, they should be considered in pari materia." Bradley v. Board of Butler County Comm'rs, 20 Kan. App.2d 602, Syl. ¶ 4, 890 P.2d 1228 (1995). While K.S.A. 79-1476 deals with the classification of property for ad valorem tax purposes, and K.S.A. 79-3606 deals with exemptions from sales and compensating use taxes, both are tax statutes and, therefore, should be considered in pari materia. Based upon the above definitions, we conclude KDR has promulgated a regulation that is significantly more restrictive in the definition of agricultural use or farming than is contemplated by statute and common definition. As such, the regulation is invalid to the extent it defines agricultural use and farming in a more restrictive sense than the statutes. 870*870 Briefly, we look to another jurisdiction to support our decision here. Petitioner cites two cases from other states to support its position. Only one is relevant to the facts presented. In Benken v. Porterfield, 18 Ohio St.2d 133, 247 N.E.2d 749 (1969), the Supreme Court of Ohio was asked to define the phrase "used in agriculture" as such applied to the taxation of personal property under the Ohio code. The taxpayer was a florist engaged in the business of planting, cultivating, harvesting, and selling flowers and vegetables. The Ohio Board of Tax Appeals said the term agriculture or farming only included items grown outside in large fields and did not include plants grown in greenhouses. 18 Ohio St.2d at 134-35. The Benken court concluded the word "agriculture" was neither ambiguous nor difficult to construe and adopted a dictionary definition that agriculture was the science or art of producing plants and animals useful to humans and in varying degrees included the preparation of such products for human use and disposal. 18 Ohio St.2d at 137. This case is clearly analogous to Benken in that KDR has attempted to limit the applicability of K.S.A. 79-3606 to only those crops grown for use as a food product or used in textile production. Using the common meaning of "agricultural use" and the definition provided by K.S.A. 79-1476, the terms "agricultural use" and "farming" would include operations such as petitioner's. Consequently, KDR has acted beyond the jurisdiction conferred by law, K.S.A. 77-621(c)(2), and its action was unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious, K.S.A. 77-621(c)(8). Reversed and remanded.
