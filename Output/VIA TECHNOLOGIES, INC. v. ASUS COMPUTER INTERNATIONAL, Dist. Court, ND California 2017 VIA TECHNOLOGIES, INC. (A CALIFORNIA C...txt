ORDER RE SEALING MOTIONS ORDER RE SEALING MOTIONS [Re: ECF 217, 218, 231, 239] [Re: ECF 217, 218, 231, 239] BETH LABSON FREEMAN, District Judge. This order addresses the parties' administrative motions to file under seal portions of their briefing and exhibits in support of their summary judgment motions. ECF 217, 218, 231, 239. For the reasons stated below, the motions are GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. I. LEGAL STANDARD I. LEGAL STANDARD "Historically, courts have recognized a `general right to inspect and copy public records and documents, including judicial records and documents.'" Kamakana v. City and Cnty. of Honolulu, 447 F.3d 1172, 1178 (9th Cir. 2006) (quoting Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 597 & n.7 (1978)). Consequently, access to motions and their attachments that are "more than tangentially related to the merits of a case" may be sealed only upon a showing of "compelling reasons" for sealing. Ctr. for Auto Safety v. Chrysler Grp., LLC, 809 F.3d 1092, 1101-02 (9th Cir. 2016). Filings that are only tangentially related to the merits may be sealed upon a lesser showing of "good cause." Id. at 1097. In addition, sealing motions filed in this district must be "narrowly tailored to seek sealing only of sealable material." Civil L.R. 79-5(b). A party moving to seal a document in whole or in part must file a declaration establishing that the identified material is "sealable." Civ. L.R. 79-5(d)(1)(A). "Reference to a stipulation or protective order that allows a party to designate certain documents as confidential is not sufficient to establish that a document, or portions thereof, are sealable." Id. II. DISCUSSION II. DISCUSSION The Court has reviewed the parties' sealing motions and declarations in support thereof. The Court finds the parties have articulated compelling reasons to seal certain portions of most of the submitted documents. For requests that were denied below, the parties' declarations fail to establish that the identified material is "sealable." Civ. L.R. 79-5(d)(1)(A). "Reference to a stipulation or protective order that allows a party to designate certain documents as confidential is not sufficient to establish that a document, or portions thereof, are sealable." Id. The compelling reasons standard must be met even as to documents that were previously filed under seal or protective order. Kamakana, 447 F.3d at 1179. The Court further notes that certain but not all proposed redactions are narrowly tailored. The Court's rulings on the sealing requests are set forth in the tables below: A. ECF 217 A. ECF 217 Identification of Documents Description of Documents Court's Order to be Sealed and Request Notice of Motion and Motion Highlighted portions at GRANTED as to the For Summary Judgment Pages 9-12, 14, and 15 in their highlighted positions.

The Court finds these documents as those "traditionally kept secret," such as grand jury transcripts and warrant materials during the pre-indictment phase of an investigation, and thus sealable. Kamakana, 447 F.3d at 1185. Exs. F and G to Zhang Decl. These exhibits are certified GRANTED. translations of Exs. A and B to Wang Decl. These are sealable for the same reasons as Exs.

ECF 231 Identification of Documents Description of Documents Court's Order to be Sealed and Request Ex. 1 to Gomez Decl. ISO This exhibit is an expert report GRANTED as to pages 45-51, Plaintiffs' opposition to and VIA seeks to seal the 102-103, 105-106, 108, 110, Defendants' Summary entirety of this exhibit because and 112; and paragraphs 117-123, Judgment Motion it contains trade secret 188-198; and DENIED as information on VIA's to remainder. products. However, sealing the entire exhibit is not justified because not all paragraphs pertain to sealable information. This request is thus not narrowly tailored. ASUS seeks to seal pages 45-51, 102-103, 105-106, 108, 110, and 112; and paragraphs 117-123, 188-198 because they contain design and manufacture information on ASMedia's chips. D. ECF 239 D.

Exhibit 25 to the Declaration This is purportedly an expert DENIED. of Paul A. Kroeger in Support report of James Pampinella of Plaintiffs' Reply. and VIA seeks to seal the entirety of this exhibit because it contains confidential revenue and sales information. VIA fails to file an unredacted version of this exhibit, preventing the Court from evaluating whether the entire exhibit contains sealable information and that the redaction is narrowly tailored. III. ORDER III. ORDER For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART the sealing motions at ECF 217, 218, 231, 239. Under Civil Local Rule 79-5(e)(2), for any request that has been denied because the party designating a document as confidential or subject to a protective order has not provided sufficient reasons to seal, the submitting party must file the unredacted (or lesser redacted) documents into the public record no earlier than 4 days and no later than 10 days form the filing of this order. Alternatively, the moving party may also renew the motion so to provide sufficient reasons in the supporting declarations no later than 10 days form the filing of this order. IT IS SO ORDERED.
